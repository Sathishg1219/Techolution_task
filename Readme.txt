---> I have read the input_list.csv and have passed the 'ISBN-13' numbers one by one into the 'ebook' link using 'f' string

---> Using selenium i have passed all the urls and coverted into an bs4 element with the python library 'Beautifulsoup'


---> From the response tag elements all the Required datas of 'ebook' are captured.


---> And have navigated to 'Book' by capturing the all links of 'Book' category.


---> All datas are captured using selenium and Beautifulsoup libarary


---> Finally the 'audio book' are also captured as same as 'Book' category


---> I have used Regex i.e Regular Expressions for some needs.


---> Finally all datas are exported in an csv named 'Output.csv'
